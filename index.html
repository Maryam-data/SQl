    <h1 style="color:blue;">visualizations projects </h1>
    Some of projects that i did individually or with team.
    <h2 style="color:blue;">Project details</h2>

    <h3 >1: Number of years women are expected to live longer than men in developed country such USA</h3>
    <p>In this project use pandas library in python to import data, cleaning data and analyzing from world Development Indicator Database then use matplotlib to visualize the result.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Maryam-data/Men-or-women-project/blob/master/mini%20project.ipynb" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>2: Profit analysis on supper sotre</h3>
    <p>In this project use tableau to make Dynamic dashboard from three diffrent profit analysis on supper sotre file,this dashboard contains three kinds of graphs:</p>
    <p>profit Vs subcategory-profit between states-profit Vs manufacturer <p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Maryam-data/SQl_queryproject/blob/master/tablue.pdf" target="_blank">profit dashboard with tableau</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>3: Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude</h3>
    <p>In this project use google map api to graph data (Latitude,wind speed, cloudiness, temperature) from google map for 500 random cities and make visualizations dashboard </p>
    <p>In this dashboard, created an individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them.</p>
    <p>These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations <p>
    <p> also put a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://maryam-data.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Latitude Analysis Dashboard(Css & bootstrap) </a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>4: Climate Analysis and Exploration/Climate App</h3>
    <p>In this project use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of our climate database and use Falsk applicaton to write the climate application for client. </p>
    <p>Using Sql alchemy library in python to interact between python and sql database, use inspecter to scrape data from some web sites and  use matplotlib to plot histogarm, box plot, area plot for data visualization</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Maryam-data/SQl-Alchemy/blob/master/climate_starter.ipynb" target="_blank">SQl_alchemy_python</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>5: Analysis-Recordset-of-Rides-Project </h3>
    <p> In this project supposed to analyzing ride sharing data and visualize that base on two data base: data/city_data.csv & data/ride_data.csv to find : </p>
    <p>Total number of rides Vs Avarage fares in each city - Total Fares by City Type - Total Rides by City Type</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Maryam-data/Analysis-Recordset-of-Rides-Project/blob/master/pyber%20.ipynb" target="_blank">Excel-python</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>6: Analysis the best area to live for each Group of people according their situation </h3>
    <p> Our Project is based around creating graphs that rank neighborhoods in cities based on different categories.</p>
    <p> please visit the presentation file which i attached for you.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>6: Current project </h3>
    <p>working with python, javascript, Flask app and Plotly library(map, pie Char, line graph)  in d3 to write visualization application for client .</p>
